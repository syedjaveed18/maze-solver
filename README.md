As shown in the above display of project, we have the help the user to find the path from origin to target.

A matrix consists of 0s and 1s, in which 0s represents the free path and 1s represnts the obstacles(i.e you can go through it) and it also consists of target value.
A **Depth first algoritm(DFS)** is developed which will find the **shortest** possible path form source to target.
